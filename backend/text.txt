backend/

This is optional if you only rely on the blockchain for your backend logic. However, many dApps or web3 apps still have a server for tasks like user authentication, aggregator APIs, or storing game/quiz data that doesn’t make sense on-chain.
server.js (or index.js): Your Node.js entry point.
routes/: Group your API routes by feature (e.g., /auth, /quiz, etc.).
controllers/: Business logic for each route.
models/: If you’re using an off-chain DB (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.) for user data, high scores, or quiz definitions.
utils/: Helper libraries (logging, error handling, etc.).
package.json: Backend Node.js dependencies.
